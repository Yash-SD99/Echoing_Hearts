# Echoing Hearts 💖  
by **Mystery Makers**

## 🌟 Overview
**Echoing Hearts** is an app that helps people connect anonymously and gradually reveal their identity in steps.  
Users can drop whispers on a map at their current location, read whispers from others, and start conversations that slowly uncover the mystery behind each connection.
